# Topics in Cognitive Psychology: Psychological Interventions Using Digital Technologies	

## Course description
In this course, the students will deal with current research findings on the use of different digital technologies for conducting psychological interventions in various domains, such as education, training, and health. Further, this course provides an overview of certain digital technologies (virtual reality, serious games, etc.) which will be analysed by students.

## Objectives 
Students know the current research findings on the use of digital in context of psychological interventions and are able to critically discuss and reflect on them.

## Overall goal
Joint creation of a repository with best practice examples of psychological interventions using digital technologies
#### Benchmark
Have a look at [https://www.clearinghouse.edu.tum.de/]. It is the Clearing House at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). The Clearing House Teaching sees itself as an interface between educational research and educational practice and is aimed at teacher educators in all phases of teacher training. Our aim is to summarise current scientific findings on effective STEM teaching in secondary education and to prepare them for teacher training in a way that is appropriate for the target group. In this way, the Clearing House Teaching makes an important contribution to improving and continuously expanding the scientific basis for teacher education and the evidence-based action of teachers.

In the current course I planned to create such a clearing house in more simplistic but not less important way. Together with you I want to create a repository of meta-analyses in the domain of digital technologies and communicate its results to relevant stakeholders. 
We will focus the use of digital technologies for providing psychological interventions. 
I mader some suggestions below, but we can easily extend it - the only requirements are
- there needs to be a meta-analysis on the topic/technology/domain
- it needs to be about a "psychological" intervention
- it needs to use some sort of digital technology 

I suggest to focus on the following domains and technologies.
